# vampiros

prototype for a Strategy/Interactive Fiction type of game.

control the patriarch of a vampire family on his route to build a powerfull family while avoiding detecting and feeding his instincts.  

what I learned from this prototype:
 - Game design is hard 
 - Writting IF takes a lot of time

future for this prototype:
 - Nothing yet, probably.  I have already learned everything to learn from it. 
 
what you can do with this code:  take inspiration of what not to do :D
